## Reasons to Choose Fabric

| **Feature**                             | **Fabric**                                            | **Spigot**                                            | **Paper**                                             |
|-----------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| **Design**                              | Modular, lightweight, designed for modding           | Plugin-based system with a focus on compatibility    | Plugin-based, performance-focused with slight game mechanic changes |
| **Flexibility**                         | High – direct access to Minecraft’s internal code using **Mixins** for deep customisation | Limited by plugin API, less flexibility in modifying core gameplay | Moderate – performance tweaks but some game mechanics altered |
| **Performance**                         | Optimised for performance with minimal overhead       | Can suffer from performance hits with too many plugins | Better performance than Spigot but alters vanilla mechanics |
| **Update Speed**                        | Fast updates, often ahead of other platforms         | Slower to update due to reliance on plugin APIs       | Updates are tied to Spigot (as Paper depends on it). In the future this may change becuase Paper has now become a hard fork. |
| **Customisation**                       | Complete freedom to modify core mechanics, even adding new game systems | Limited to plugin API restrictions                   | Customisation possible but limited by Paper’s changes to gameplay |
| **Server-side Mods**                    | Ideal for server-side only modifications without needing client-side changes | Focus on plugins that affect both server and client  | Similar to Spigot with some server-side optimisations |
| **Compatibility with Minecraft Versions** | High – updates quickly after Minecraft releases      | Slower, with more challenges keeping up with new versions | Moderate, may have compatibility issues due to changes in mechanics |
| **Community**                           | Growing rapidly, with many developers switching       | Large established community, but slower updates      | Large established community, focused on performance optimisations |
| **Freedom and Control**                 | Unmatched flexibility in modifying Minecraft’s core systems | Limited control due to reliance on external plugin systems | Less control over core systems due to the focus on performance |
