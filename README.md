## Why use Fabric instead of Paper / Spigot?

See [`switch-to-fabric.md`](./switch-to-fabric.md).

### TL;DR:

If you're still using **Spigot** or **Paper** for your Minecraft server, you're missing out. **Fabric** is the future, offering unparalleled **performance**, **flexibility**, and **rapid updates**. Here's why you need to switch:

- **Full Control and Flexibility**: Modify Minecraftâ€™s core systems with **Mixins** for deep, server-side customisation.
- **Optimised Performance**: Lightweight design ensures minimal overhead, keeping your server fast and responsive.
- **Faster Updates**: **Fabric** updates quickly with new Minecraft versions, often ahead of other platforms.
- **Advanced Customisation**: Go beyond traditional plugins with **Mixins** to tweak everything from mobs to redstone systems.
- **Growing Community**: Join a fast-growing community of developers and server admins who are already embracing **Fabric**.

**Fabric** is the ideal choice for anyone serious about customising their server and staying ahead of the game. **Switch today!**

> [!IMPORTANT]
> I want to clarify that I do not hate Spigot or Paper, and I do not encourage the spread of negativity or hate towards them. Both platforms have their merits and have been invaluable to the Minecraft community. My aim is simply to highlight the benefits of Fabric and explain why it might be the better choice for certain use cases. Every platform has its strengths, and the goal should always be to choose the tool that best fits your needs, not to disparage others. Let's continue to support and grow the community, regardless of the platform we choose.
